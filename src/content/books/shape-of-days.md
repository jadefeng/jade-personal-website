Key takeaway: design your days, not just your tasks. Burkeman argues that time is finite, so constraints are
features. My favorite tactic is the idea of a daily highlight—one meaningful thing that defines a good day,
even if the rest is chaos.

I also liked his reminder to build “closed” tasks that can be finished. A finished page in a notebook beats a
massive list that never ends. This website follows the same idea: small, finished posts, not sprawling drafts.
