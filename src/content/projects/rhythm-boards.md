Rhythm Boards is a lightweight ritual builder for small teams. It replaces noisy dashboards with a weekly
rhythm, a single page status view, and a short planning loop.

What I focused on:
- A one-minute status ritual that doesn't require endless updates.
- Soft visual hierarchy to keep the board calm even when full.
- Weekly check-in templates that are easy to repeat.
