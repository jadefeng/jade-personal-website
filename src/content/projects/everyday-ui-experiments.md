This is my playground to practice detail. Each week I ship a tiny UI experiment focused on clarity and
delight: hover states, typography, spacing, and motion that feels intentional.

Favorite experiments so far:
- A single-card layout that adapts to long content without feeling crowded.
- Gentle motion for context changes, not decoration.
- Neutral palettes that keep the focus on hierarchy and rhythm.
