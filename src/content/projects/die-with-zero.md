## Project Overview
I grew up in an immigrant family where frugality was a core value, so saving always felt virtuous and spending required justification. Die With Zero resonated with me because of its idea of “experience compound interest”, where experiences earlier in life can deliver more long-term value than money saved for later, especially given that time and energy are finite. 

The goal of this project is to make the "die with zero" idea feel tangible.

## Project Steps 
I started by testing the idea with Claude Code, but quickly ran into friction. It tended to regenerate the entire codebase on each change, which meant long iteration cycles and running into character limits.

That forced me to slow down and I wrote a lightweight PRD to clarify requirements, scope, and what “done” actually meant.

I switched to Replit, and the experience was much simpler. Iteration was faster, and it felt much closer to real prompt-driven product development. Easily worth the $25/month.

Once the app was working, I launched it to the public:
- Bought a domain on Namecheap and set up HTTPS via Cloudflare
- Dealt with DNS, subdomains, and verification 
- Used ChatGPT + Nano Banana to experiment with a thumbnail and favicon
- Connected Replit to GitHub so I could manage versions and avoid losing progress
- Used ChatGPT to help set things up and debugging infrastructure issues
