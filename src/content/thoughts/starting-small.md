Most personal sites fail because they try to do too much on day one. A calm cadence beats heroic effort. The
goal is to create a small loop you enjoy repeating: pick a topic, write a few sentences, polish the edges,
publish. The more often you close that loop, the easier it is to trust your own taste.

I set a recurring reminder to ship something small each week. Sometimes it is a UI polish pass, other times a
single paragraph I want to keep. The important part: the work is visible, the loop is short, and the friction
is low.
