      <p>
        I’m a product thinker who enjoys building thoughtful, human-centered products at scale. Outside of work, I’m happiest riding horses, trying new food, traveling solo, and refining the little details that make life feel well-designed.
        
         This site is my steady cadence for
        shipping in public: projects, thinking, and notes that might help someone else.
