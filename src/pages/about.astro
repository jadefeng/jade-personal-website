        I like crafting clear, intentional experiences. My background spans product design, front-end
        engineering, and shaping small bets that move teams forward. This site is my steady cadence for
        shipping in public—projects, thinking, and notes that might help someone else.

        Outside the browser you’ll find me on long walks, editing half-finished essays, or tinkering with
        analog tools like notebooks and cameras.
