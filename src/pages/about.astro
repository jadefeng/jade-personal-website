      <p>
        I’m a product thinker who enjoys building thoughtful, human-centered products at scale. Outside of work, 
        I’m happiest riding horses, cooking, trying new food, reading, and traveling solo.
        
         This site is my steady cadence for
        shipping things in public: projects, thinking, and notes that might help someone else.
